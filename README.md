Trying to do kaggle contest Santander_Value_Prediction_Challenge,and this is my first time
coding python and learn how to use data model to run data set.
In my experiment,used atleast four models to upload my contest score,
I found PCA combining LGB can make the score higher. you can try this PCA&LGB and 
something awesome data model to learn how to adjust parameter in these models.
